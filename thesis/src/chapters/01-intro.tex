\chapter{Introduction}
\label{chapter:intro}
In any industry, there is no one man team. Although there are situations where for amusement purposes a single person does in parallel all the activities of an entire/team band, the scope is always the same: entertainment. But to obtain performance, a team is necessary. The situation can be easily compared to the programming concepts of threads: you have more workers that do separate tasks, but they need to be somehow synchronized or coordinated. Teams are in theory the easiest way to increase the throughput, but where there are multiple persons there also are different opinions. Although the boss was the person in charge of controlling and setting the direction, the position now shifts to leadership where control is relinquished and direction is hinted.

Leadership is present in most of the possible environments and industries, but the one that I find most interesting is the IT industry. The reason behind the interest is the fact that the IT industry is considered a spoiled industry. A spoiled industry is described as being an industry where the average salary packages are above (at least 3 to 4 times) the average salary in a country and where the number of open positions is higher than the number of possible candidates. Two companies that I have interacted with (names undisclosed) reported that the number of accepted employment offers is between 50-60\% of the total of extended offers. 

In the situation when it is hard to find new employees it becomes mandatory to have a high retention rate. Due to this fact, IT companies have started to use people management techniques in order to maintain the existing employees happy and performing.

\section{Team Leadership Concept}
\label{sec:tl}
Team Leadership in the IT industry is a concept that is centered around building products using the capabilities of the teams. Although the name says \textbf{team leadership} the emphasis is still on building \textbf{products}. Although there are multiple ways to deliver high quality products, good leadership is the an important topic that can determine the health of the organization. Team leadership is all about utilizing the strengths of each individual team member in such a way that it adds value to the team and helps bring the best outcome of the projects. The team leader role is not a \textbf{rock start position} but it is a role of great responsibility. As John C. Maxwell said, bad or good leadership can make the difference between successful or unsuccessful projects:
\begin{displayquote}
Teamwork makes the dream work, but a vision becomes a nightmare when the leader has a big dream and a bad team.
\end{displayquote}
Team leadership is not about having a crowned person in frond of the team. It's about having a group of people focused on the same goal and motivated to do their best to achieve it. It also means to set the stage for the teams success and standing in the back when they succeed. 

As described in \cite{abur-tl}, leadership is both the art and the science to be productive through the strength of the team. It's the art to motivate and focus people around a common goal in order to deliver great products.

From a technical point of view the role of team leader is responsible of delivering a high quality product on time by leveraging the knowledge of each member. As detailed in \ref{sec:flavorurs} there are two main directions for leading a project oriented team.

The first one is the position of \textbf{technical leader} that will set (or even enforce) the technical solution, while the team is responsible for implementing the vision of the technical lead. The draw back of this approach comes when the visions of the members and lead are not aligned, leading to conflicts inside the team or even the need for the lead to take over tasks from the reports in order to deliver on time.

The second approach is represented by a position of \textbf{team coach} that guides the team to come up with solutions (even if they are not as he envision or even the best possible) in order to achieve the desired product. In this situation he does not enforce his solutions and helps the members develop their skills by both coming up with the design solution and implementation. His role in this case is to help and coach the team and not to enforce the technical solution. The drawback of this approach is that on the short term the time needed to develop new features may increase (depending on the expertise of the team), but while the team continues to grow it's skills this time will start to shorten.

Neither of the two approaches are favorable all the times. In case of short term projects (one to six months) a technical leadership could be favored because the time will not permit the members to learn new skills and strong guidance will be needed. On the other hand for projects that last more that half a year, a coaching approach would be better because in this case all the members learn new approaches to solve tasks and they even develop their soft-skills.

\section{People Management Concept}
\label{sec:proj-scope}
Compared to team leadership, people management does not focus directly on product delivery. The focus for people management is to bring out the best out of the biggest resource that a company has: the people. In the IT industry it is difficult to hire new employees, but it is very easy to lose them. The reason behind this is the fact that there are more open positions than new software engineers. This means that as an IT professional it is quite easy to find a well paying job in a short period of time, in the meantime it also means that as an IT recruiter it is quite difficult to find new suitable candidates for the position that are open.
