Software companies have different ways to organize their teams, each based on the development methodology they use, or better said based on their interpretation of the methodology.

\todo {Describe how different organizations tackle team leadership}



There are cases when the leadership of the team is usually done by the person who has the most technical experience, sometimes called as a \textbf{coding guru}. The reason why this kind of person is appointed as team leader is the fact that  the senior management needs a solid technical voice to represent the team in front of the client. On the other hand the most technical person may not be oriented on developing the skills of the team members and is usually focused only on delivering the project (often by a great effort on the coding part from his side)

The last kind of team leader is the person that can communicate easily with the team members and also with the clients or senior management. The reason a person with great soft -skills is in charge of a technical team is represented by the fact that he can usually ask the correct questions in order to help each member solve the issue that he is working on, while not providing the correct answer. This fact helps the team to grow by empowering the members and by helping them reach the answers they need.

The most popular development framework currently used, Agile Scrum, usually has a mediator, and not a leader called Scrum Master. The Scrum Master has the main responsibility  to solve impediments of non-technical (e.g.: obtaining hardware resources, facilitating meetings). Not being mandatory for the Scrum Master to be a technical person, he does not have the obligation to coach people, but he must ensure that the team is not impended because of lack of resources.
