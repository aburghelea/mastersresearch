Software companies have different ways to organize their teams, each based on the development methodology they use, or better said based on their interpretation of the methodology.
\subsection{Existing visions about team leaders}
\label{sub-sec:existingvisionsaboutteamleaders}
\todo {Describe how different organizations tackle team leadership}



There are cases when the leadership of the team is usually done by the person who has the most technical experience, sometimes called as a \textbf{coding guru}. The reason why this kind of person is appointed as team leader is the fact that  the senior management needs a solid technical voice to represent the team in front of the client. On the other hand the most technical person may not be oriented on developing the skills of the team members and is usually focused only on delivering the project (often by a great effort on the coding part from his side)

The last kind of team leader is the person that can communicate easily with the team members and also with the clients or senior management. The reason a person with great soft -skills is in charge of a technical team is represented by the fact that he can usually ask the correct questions in order to help each member solve the issue that he is working on, while not providing the correct answer. This fact helps the team to grow by empowering the members and by helping them reach the answers they need.

The most popular development framework currently used, Agile Scrum, usually has a mediator, and not a leader called Scrum Master. The Scrum Master has the main responsibility  to solve impediments of non-technical (e.g.: obtaining hardware resources, facilitating meetings). Not being mandatory for the Scrum Master to be a technical person, he does not have the obligation to coach people, but he must ensure that the team is not impended because of lack of resources.

\subsubsection{The person with the most technical experience}

During the periods when projects were being developed using a \textit{Waterfall approach} the team leader position was filled by a person with a lot of experience in the industry (usually more than 7 years). His main objective (set by the company management) was to deliver the project on time with the team that he has. The main advantage of this kind of person would be his vast technical knowledge that would help him design the architecture of the application and enforce decisions of how the application is implemented. Usually this kind of leader is called a \textbf{technical leader}.

The main skills that are taken into account when a person is appointed as a technical leader are:

\begin{itemize}
\item has a vast experience with the kind of project that is being developed
\item has good knowledge of programming languages, APIs and frameworks
\item understands the impact of changing the frameworks or APIs
\item has the ability to make technical decisions
\item is good at explaining technical solutions
\item is accountable for his decisions
\item is loyal to the company and management team
\item is trustworthy
\item gets things done
\end{itemize}

The disadvantages of having a technical leader is represented by the fact that he alone has the objective and power to steer the design of the application. It is his duty (and his alone) to decide how the architecture will be implemented and what technologies will be used. This approach does not empower the team to develop their skills and thus the members will not come with new ideas or possible technical approaches. Often the team members see themselves as implementers of the ideas guided out by the leader. 

While the technical leader delegates the implementation to various team members he will often have the tendency to assign the implementation of each module based on the seniority level of the member that will to implement it. He will assign a task to a member that has all the skills to solve it in time. The assigning decision is made only on the previous experience of the member and a technical leader will not challenge the members by giving them tasks that they can not solve with their current skills. By doing this, he does not develop the technical skills of the team. Using this approach, the technical leader will always implement the most difficult tasks by himself believing that he alone can solve them. This requires extra effort from his part to balance the design of the application, implementing his own technical tasks and providing fast technical answers to the team when they get impeded.

From a team perspective, the technical leader has to have the following traits:

\begin{itemize}
\item is fair
\item gets along with the members
\item is available and approachable to provide strait forward answers to technical questions
\item has good understanding of the business domain
\end{itemize}


\subsubsection{The person with great soft-skills}
\todo{RD: Sa ai in vedere cum poti masura asta}

The second flavour of team leader is the person who know how to ask the right questions in order to help his peers reach the answer by themselves, thus developing their problem solving skills without providing the solution.

Roy Osherove describes this person as a leader that coordinates his team by the following quote \cite{notes-to-a-software-team-leader}:

\begin{displayquote}
``There are no experts. There is only us''
\end{displayquote} 

The reasoning behind the previous quote is not the fact that the team has to develop a product based just on their current skills. It means that the team should not wait for the arrival of a person that already has experience to use the necessary tools and frameworks, but instead they should become the experts by developing their skills and knowledge base. 

This approach has a mandatory requirement of slack time. Slack time does not mean that the team does not work for the company and wastes time browsing the internet. Slack time represents the period of time necessary for the team to learn how to use various technologies. It is called slack time because the output is not directly visible in a set of finished tasks for the project functionality. The output of slack time is a set of new skills that the members of the team have acquired by learning and experimenting with new tools.

The main objective of this kind of team leader is to motivate and coordinate a team in order to deliver good software with the effort of the team. The team leader is not necessarily the most experienced programmer from the team, but is able to clearly communicate the project expectations. He has to create enough slack time to ensure that the team has the necessary time to learn.

The main skills that are taken into account when a person is appointed as a technical leader are:

\begin{itemize}
\item has good communication skills
\item has people management skills
\item can motivate the team members to learn new technologies
\item can steer the development focus
\item know how to manage time
\item understands that the team knowledge is more important that personal experience
\item is able to delegate work
\item is a good listener, respects other people's opinions
\item is a good conflict resolver
\end{itemize}

The difference between a team leader and a technical leader is that the team leader does not make the technical decisions by himself, he challenges the team to come up with solutions and he just signs of on the agreed one, while the later decides how things will be implemented and delegates just the execution. The team leader encourages the team to develop their decision making skills by empowering the team, making them accountable for the decision; The team decides what and how it is implemented, the result is their work from design phase to implementation. This approach ensures a better engagement from the members because they are not just implementers, they are influencers, their ideas impact the project directly.

The team leaders responsibility is coaching. This means that he has the role of helping the team make decisions instead of making them for the team. The main weapon of a team leader is empowerment. He lets the team steer the project and helps them solve differences by asking questions, not answering.
