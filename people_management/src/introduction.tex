Employees are the biggest asset a company can have and in the IT industry they can make the difference between the rise and fall of a business. 
The employees attitude and performance can easily make the difference between a \SI{1}[\$]{M} company and a \SI{10}[\$]{M} company.

One of the trickiest parts of a manager is people management, which means that he is in charge of motivating, training, courages and even defends the employees if the situation requires it. In the same time the manager is also in charge of firing, disciplining and evaluating his employees. Although this responsibilities usually seem to be at in opposition, the integration of both positive and negative aspects makes the difference between a successful and unsuccessful manager that is able to create a good and productive environment.

Although employees are considered human resources, they are not inventory and according to H. Ross Perot:
\begin{displayquote}
``People cannot be managed. Inventories can be managed, but people must be lead.''
\end{displayquote}
This already hints that the naming of \textit{people management} is a poor choice of words, but the responsibilities of a person in this position start to migrate from the management sphere into the leadership sphere.

\subsection{People Management Concept}
\label{sub-sec:pmconcept}

In big organizations, usually there is a hierarchy of management that helps keep the company running smoothly. Being a good manager is one of the toughest and sometimes the least acknowledged jobs. A manager has to both lead by example and also manage expectations. The management positions come in a lot of flavours varying from project management, branch management and ending with people management. 

Managers know that the critical difference between success and failure is made by the people. In the same time, surprisingly, there is little research demonstrating the link between people management and business performance. 

Although each company has it's own flavour of people management, it is very wide spread and accepted that a people manager is a person that manages one or more individuals and has the following attributions:
\begin{itemize}
\item hiring
\item creating job descriptions
\item creating and advising on career planes
\item performance evaluation
\item firing
\item receiving resignations
\end{itemize}

Overall the people manager job is a pragmatic and results oriented type of work where a person has to find the correct balance between company performance and employee satisfaction.

It usually has nothing to do with being a human resources person, but usually helps to have some HR knowledge (eg: legal notice period). 

Although a people manager usually focuses on the motivating and increasing the performance of the employees, they have to be aware that difficult situations (eg: firing) often arise and always keep in mind Donald Trumps quote:

\begin{displayquote}
``It's nothing personal. It's just business.''
\end{displayquote}
