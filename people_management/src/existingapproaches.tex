People management can be tackled in different ways, depending on who is responsible for it. The main classification for people management is:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Human Resources responsibility
\item Team Leader responsibility 
\item Dedicated branch of people managers
\end{enumerate}

Each of this approaches have it's advantages but also disadvantages, that are detailed bellow:
\subsection{Dedicated subdivision of the Human Resources department}
\label{subsec:hrdep}

The human resources department is responsible for hiring, firing and legal paper-work related to employees but not their direct working field. In the same time, they could be in charge with ensuring enough motivation for the existing employees. Having people evaluated by the same department will help the company have coherency across the entire company by using the same guidelines. On the other hand evaluations about performance of each employee by persons who do not have direct experience in the field, may prove unfavourable for the employee. This comes from the fact that a technical employee may have delivered a product that is high quality, but with very few resources or resources that are very difficult to use, while in the same time another one could have delivered a product with the same quality but had access to more and better resources. In this case the first employee should be ranked higher than the second, but it can be very difficult for a HR representative to grasp the reason to why this should be. 

By the fact that an employee is evaluated by someone who has no direct experience in the working field (e.g.: programmer evaluated by a behavioural expert) we end up in the same situation, anonymously quoted only (and sometimes attributed to Einstein \cite{aeq}):
